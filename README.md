**“Clean the Galaxy, One Sweep at a Time!"**

By 2080, Earth's orbit has become a cosmic graveyard, a massive junkyard of space debris threatening the survival of humanity's spacefaring future. This is where you come in: the brave (if slightly underpaid) space janitor. Your enemies aren't fearsome alien warriors—they're just mountains of cosmic trash!<br />
<br />
You pilot a Thor Cleaning Ship, sweeping the orbit clean by blasting away these junk invaders. The more you clean, the safer and shinier Earth becomes. With your trusty ship, you'll blast through debris, protect humanity's future, and prove that even trash duty can make you a hero.<br />
